We still live in a time like that, but most of us don't realize it.",

    description: "This book is about a walking contradiction: A man who was often guileless but had deep psychological insight into his opponents on the battlefield. A man who was resolute, courageous, and bold but also struggled with alcoholism, standing up to his in-laws, and cutting venomous people out of his circle when required. Someone who spent all his mortal energies extinguishing the confederacy and then the ku klux klan, but in a moment of weakness enacted racist policies against Jewish people which he spent the rest of his life repenting for and attempting to fix. We owe a lot to this humble leather store clerk from Galena, Illinois who became one of the greatest heroes of the republic. At the bare minimum, we owe it to him to not use our own imperfections as excuses to shirk responsibility and service.",

This is also a book about how difficult personalities across disparate disciplines were able to come together to make brilliant advances.",

  title: "Founders Dilemmas by Noam Wasserman",
  description: "Founderâ€™s Dilemmas is an ultra detailed book about why startups fail, based on a dataset of thousands of high-growth ventures. The core thesis of the book, with much variation and nuance, is that founders are typically either motivated by control or by financial gain, and at each stage of a firmâ€™s development the choices you have to make can bifurcate along those lines. If you have a company where the founders are not aligned in their desired outcome, the company stands to tear itself apart. The book details all sorts of other research about correlates of startup success, including things like hiring templates, equity splits, funding sources, and much more. Thereâ€™s a lot of food for reflection in this book.",

title: "Zero to One by Peter Thiel",
description: "Peter Thiel, the ever-contrary, ever-vexing PayPal paladin performed a feat of expository dexterity when he wrote this book. That sentence was fun to write. But this book was more fun to read. Thiel describes a world teeming with secrets, seeds of great startups lying dormant just beyond our grasp. He made me feel strongly that with hard work, first-principles thinking, and cultivating knowledge you can find great ideas that can change the world. He also lays out details about how and why you should aim to monopolize your market, how to grow your business, recruit great talent, and grapple with with the harsh reality of power laws. This is definitely a book I come back to time and again, and in some ways a stark counterpoint to Eric Riesâ€™ Lean Startup methodology, in that Thiel advocates have a concrete, compelling view of the future and driving towards it instead of hedging your bets and iterating your way to a local maxima. Thereâ€™s a lot of value in Riesâ€™ methodology each book in some ways tempers and checks the ideas of the other.",

title: "The Lean Startup by Eric Ries",
description: "The Lean Startup is a classic text that frames the startup as a series of hypotheses that need validation and refinement in order to become actionable. The core idea is to create a loop whereby you build lightweight experimental products/features, measure their performance with actionable metrics, learn from the results and modify the product. But as with the other two books in this section, thereâ€™s a ton of detail on a wide array of relevant topics, case studies, examples of successes and failures, and more. This is the kind of book you return to time and again to squeeze all the value out of it.",

The tale of Odysseus, the old campaigner, the man of exploits teaches us among other things that sometimes the best way to reach our destination is to be flexible and creative rather than forceful and obstinate.",

      description: "Where would the ring-bearer be without his glowing sword, Sting, that would protect him from the forces of darkness before he even knew danger was present? Enchanted Objects is about an alternative future where the dominant mode of interaction is not a glossy black screen but rather something alive, dimensionally rich, and responsive to our needs. The book draws inspiration form fantasy novels where enchanted objects come alive and give bearers abilities they could never have dreamed of. Alexa and other voice assistants comes closer to enchanted objects than most other modern consumer electronics, but I think we can go a lot further. However, in order to do so you need to cultivate a broad multi-modal skillset and push yourself to think outside of current paradigms of digital design. Enchanted Objects pushed me to develop my programming ability, start tinkering with hardware in the form of Arduino projects, and expand my ability to draw. This is a truly beautiful book and I highly recommend it.",

I love that kind of broad thinking, intellectual courage, and willingness to tackle any challenge that comes across your path. This book also contains a plethora of examples of excellent design as well as practical tips on layout, color, typography, and how to do more with less. Another good book along these lines is Less But Better by Dieter Rams, and the movie Rams is worth a watch as well.",
