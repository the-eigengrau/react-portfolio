        description: "The Age of Wonder empowers you to think for yourself from first principles, and not outsource all your intellectual activities to specialists in the ivory tower. It's about a time when individuals felt like they could delve into a subject and unearth valuable secrets that could change the world. We still live in a time like that, but most of us don't realize it.",

These are the types of questions you'll delve into if you read this book. You'll also get a science of the excitement of the scientific process and see examples of esoteric insights from one field becoming unexpectedly actionable in other fields.",

    title: "Grant by Ron Chernow",
    description: "This book is about a walking contradiction: A man who was often guileless but had deep psychological insight into his opponents on the battlefield. A man who was resolute, courageous, and bold but also struggled with alcoholism, standing up to his in-laws, and cutting venomous people out of his circle when required. Someone who spent all his mortal energies extinguishing the confederacy and then the ku klux klan, but in a moment of weakness enacted racist policies against Jewish people which he spent the rest of his life repenting for and attempting to fix. We owe a lot to this humble leather store clerk from Galena, Illinois who became one of the greatest heroes of the republic. At the bare minimum, we owe it to him to not use our own imperfections as excuses to shirk responsibility and service.",

This book disabuses us of that notion and reminds us of the giants on whose shoulders we stand: Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper, Bob Noyce, Vannevar Bush, and many others. This is also a book about how difficult personalities across disparate disciplines were able to come together to make brilliant advances.",

This is basically the story of all succesful startups, right? The tale of Odysseus, the old campaigner, the man of exploits teaches us among other things that sometimes the best way to reach our destination is to be flexible and creative rather than forceful and obstinate.",
