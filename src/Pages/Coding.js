I also used <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> instead of standard CSS primarily so that I could nest styles and use variables in my stylesheets.

                          I've used machine learning models to predict survival rates on the Titanic, analyze deaths from gun violence, classify whether or not virus genomes are from SARS-CoV2, and predict bike-sharing demand, among other projects. <br/><br/> Data science is fascinating domain, and has a lot of product/design potential in terms of understanding and responding to user needs.
                          I've spent considerable time mastering both descriptive and predictive data analysis techniques both inside and outside of work.

                          I've coded 10+ apps as class projects in a number of online courses I've taken, including Stanford's CS193p during the Spring of 2020. Among my projects were a weather app, a chat app, a to-do app, and an emoji-art creation app. <br/><br/>
                          The most exciting side project I'm working on right now is a gamified education app for iOS and WatchOS called Mimir.
